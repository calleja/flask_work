Error Metrics for Time Series
Usually you get an improvement by using the same function to evaluate and optimize your model. In this case we can do this by simply taking the log of our target variable before passing it to the fit model.
a) Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSE)
b) bias-variance trade-off: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff

Volatility measures:
historical volatility:
- standard deviation/((sqrt(N)/(N-1))
- parkinson high-low estimator
- Rogers-Satchell

b) https://mathbabe.org/2011/07/24/measuring-historical-volatility/

consider using a zero expected mean in the vol calcs
volatility measures must be normalized such that the coverage period is the equal - may require interpolation or extrapolation
